## Life and work

I'm an Italian living and working in beautiful **Berlin**, Germany.  
I grew up in **Sardinia**, a _sunny_ island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. I have been lucky enough to spend 12 years of my life in **Tuscany**, where I ran a one-man design business while studying Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa.

I did not graduate; my job took higher priority over the years and my interests changed over time. However, my academic experience is an important aspect of my education and it contributed substantially to build the rich spectrum of skills I have today.

I am a UI/UX designer at heart, but I also like to program. I write code using mainly _JavaScript_, _Python_, _PHP_, _HTML_, _CSS_ and I feel confortable using programming tools like _Git_ in my daily work.

## Interests

I like **photography**, fixing old typewriters, and singing. During my time in Pisa, I took part in several **_mise-en-scene_ of popular operas**[^1] as a tenor, performing for theaters in Italy, Austria, and Germany.

## Colophon

All the photos[^2] used to showcase my work have been taken using both my film and digital cameras.

The content is "typesetted" using [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) and its _sans_ companion [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans), while the font I used to create the header logo is [Stacked](https://creativemarket.com/denilchan/3398-Stacked-Font) by [Denise Chandler](https://www.dcfonts.com/). 

I also used a number of other tools.[^3]

[^1]: _Rigoletto_, _Aida_, _Il Trovatore_, _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_, _Andrea Ch√©nier_ and _Cavalleria Rusticana_ to name some.
