**Italo Calvino** (15 October 1923 – 19 September 1985) was an Italian writer of short stories and novels. 

Back in 2002, I registered the domain name italocalvino.it, without knowing anything about creating websites. I just knew that I had to contribute in some way, publishing some personal writings.

During the following years, the website turned into a blog, gathering contributions from **people all over the world**.

Recently I decided to select a few — very most relevant — articles and drastically simplify the design to obtain a more static resource, strongly focused on **legibility**.
