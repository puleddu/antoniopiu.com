Turini Group is a well established _Law firm_ headed by **Laura Turini**, which takes pride in a long experience in the field of patents, trademarks and copyright protection.

I worked with Laura to build a new set of websites that could communicate the diverse legal and consulting offer while keeping a unitary company presentation. 

I created the network on a **WordPress** _multisite_ environment with some custom back-end utilities to make it easy for the client to manage content and newsletters.

The work involved the **revision of the stationery**. Particularly, business cards have been _letterpress printed_ on thick cotton paper using custom plates for the logo to give the cards both an elegant and solid feel.
