In late 2012, I was asked to create a new brand, relative stationery and website for a **mansion in Tuscany, Italy**. Particular attention was paid to creating a logo that could be easily embroidered on towels, bathrobes, etc.

Meanwhile, the project took a different direction and the work is still in progress, so I decided to publish the unused proposals as I was satisfied with the results.
