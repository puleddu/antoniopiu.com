**Papermine** is a digital magazine generator service that allows you to create *interactive pubblications* from blogs, RSS feeds and more. 

The nice guys at *Cape Kode* asked me to design some layouts for the service's themes library. The following mockups are taken from the layout of the themes *Life* and *Obl√≤*.

I am glad I took up the challenge to create some distinctive designs while keeping them faithful to the guidelines required by the multi-device nature of the Papermine resulting publications.
