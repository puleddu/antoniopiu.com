## Life and work

As you probably already guessed, my name is Antonio. I live and work in Berlin but I am from **Sardinia**, 
a sunny island in middle of the  Mediterranean Sea and I spent 11 years of my life in Pisa, **Tuscany**,
where I studied *computer engineering*, and ran a one-man design studio.

I did not graduate as my job took higher priority over the years and my interests shifted considerably. However, my academic experience is a substantial part of my education and among other amazing things, I learned what the *Kirchhoff's circuit laws* are, and how to use them. :)

I like to code my designs using *HTML*, *CSS*, *Javascript*, *PHP* and I feel confortable using tools like *Git* in my day to day work.

## Interests

I like **photography** and I like to sing, particularly classical pieces. I had the honor to take part in different **mise-en-scene of popular operas**[^2] as a tenor in a choir that exhibited in different theaters in Italy and Germany.

## Colophon {#colophon}
All the photos[^3] I used to showcase the work have been taken by me using a **Nikon D50** and an old **Hasselblad 500 C/M** film camera which mounts a great Carl Zeiss Planar 80mm lens.
