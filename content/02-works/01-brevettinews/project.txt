**Brevettinews** is an *online magazine* about intellectual property and innovation. 
The work showcased here is the second restyling I made for this magazine.

I worked with the editorial staff of Brevettinews to give the newspaper a **new logo** and a **bright design**, 
using colors to characterize the various sections.

I also designed the newsletter and made a custom WordPress setup that allows the editors 
to create newsletters that are later sent with an external service.
