Text: 

Turini Group is a well established *Law firm* headed by **Laura Turini**, which takes pride in a 
long experience in the field of patents, trademarks and copyright protection.

I worked with Laura to build a new set of websites that could communicate the diverse
legal and consulting offer while keeping a unitary company presentation. 

I created the network on a **WordPress** *multisite* environment with some custom back-end utilities to make it easy 
for the client to manage content and newsletters.

The work involved the **revision of the stationery**. Particularly, business cards have been
*letterpress printed* on thick cotton paper using custom plates for the logo to give the cards
both an elegant and solid feel.
