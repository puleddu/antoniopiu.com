**Ufficio Brevetti** is a useful resource for those that want to gain an insight into how patents, 
trademarks and copyright work.

I worked with Studio Turini to transfer the old website from static HTML to a multilanguage WordPress 
environment providing a new design that strongly focuses on the *Search* feature and the *Archive*.

**Usability** was a fundamental requirement, especially for the mobile version. Every feature and section has been taken in careful consideration to produce a **clean** and enjoyable design.
